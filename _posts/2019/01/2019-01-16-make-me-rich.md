Just a few weeks ago we made our financial model public, here is the
[PDF](https://papers.zold.io/fin-model.pdf) with a brief explanation. However,
despite all my efforts to make this model obvious and easy to understand,
there are many questions. The first one is: So, what? And the next one is:
How to become a millionaire? Let me explain.

First of all, here is a very important remark: We, in [Zerocracy](https://www.zerocracy.com), believe
that the value of bitcoin very soon will become stable enough to avoid drops, which are
larger than 47% per year. For your information, this is the spread BTC managed
to [demonstrate](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/historical-data/)
over the last years (thanks to [@ammaratef45](https://github.com/ammaratef45) for helping me prepare the data):

If you share this belief with us, read on. Otherwise, close this blog post,
forget about Zold, and invest into Apple, Facebook, Alphabet, or just make
a bank deposit.

Now, let's get to the business. This is what you do.

First, you buy one bitcoin for $3,630 (at the time of writing).

Then, you [exchange]({% post_url 2018/12/2018-12-09-btc-to-zld %})
it to 4000 zolds (current rate is [here](https://wts.zold.io/rate)).

We _promise_ to increase the rate each month, by 4%
(of course, keep in mind that it is just a promise and we may
change it in the future even without notice).

You wait a year and exchange your 4000 zolds to 1.6 bitcoins.

You sell bitcoins and get $5,343 back (you pay 8% fee for your
selling operation).

Your profit is $1,715 or 47% per year.

Not bad, huh?

What can go wrong? There are basically three risks:

  * The value of bitcoin may drop for more than 47%.

  * We may not increase the rate by 4% a month.

  * We may steal your bitcoins and disappear.

If you are ready to tolerate these risks, [join us]({% post_url 2018/12/2018-12-09-btc-to-zld %})
and start investing right away. Remember that aside from making yourself a good profit you
are helping Zerocracy, which is leading the revolution in management
and software development (read our [mission statement]({% post_url 2018/07/2018-07-08-mission %})).

Technically, the profit you will get is coming from the business
Zerocracy will make, using your bitcoins (to attract strategic venture investors).
So, by buying ZLD now you are lending bitcoins to us.
We _promise_ to return them with an interest.
