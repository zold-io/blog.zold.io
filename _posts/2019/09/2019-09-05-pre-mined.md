  Unlike some cryptocurrencies, Zold is pre-mined, which
  means that the only way to get it is to buy it from
  someone who owns it already.

[Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin),
the first cryptocurrency, was designed with a [mining](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin-mining.asp)
mechanism, which technically is an ability to create new
digital coins every day by making
[some calculations](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_work). Thanks to
this mechanism the largest holders of BTC coins are the ones who
were doing those calculations long time ago, when the cost of mining
was much lower. Bitcoin adepts [believe](https://blog.picks.co/bitcoins-distribution-was-fair-e2ef7bbbc892)
that this is the most fair principle, since the distribution
of digital assets is not centralized---anyone
can become a holder of new coins, just by purchasing the necessary
equipment and doing the hard work of mining.

There are many other cryptocurrencies, followers of Bitcoin, which
don't allow anyone to create new coins, but instead make it possible
to acquire them only by purchasing from someone who already owns them.
For example, [Ripple](https://www.ripple.com/),
[Cardano](https://www.cardano.org/en/home/),
[Stellar](https://www.stellar.org/),
[EOS](https://eos.io/),
[NEO](https://neo.org/),
[Loki](https://loki.network/) and many others.
Actually, [the majority](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7nuep3/five_of_the_top_ten_cryptocurrencies_are_premined/)
of modern cryptocurrencies are pre-mined.

Even though technically they are decentralized, meaning that anyone can
have a server with a database and participate in the [consensus protocol](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consensus-mechanism-cryptocurrency.asp)
to validate and approve transactions, ecomonically and business-wise they
are perfectly centralized: They don't allow strangers to become owners
of their coins, unless they invest real money into it.

Again, when a crypto coin is pre-mined, it only means that _initial_ acquisition
may happen only through an exchange with an existing owner. Right after that
all cryptocurrencies are the same: their coins can be acquired only by
an exchange with existing holders.

Zold, unlike Bitcoin, is pre-mined. Nobody can create new coins. The only
possible way to acquire them is to [purchase]({% post_url 2018/08/2018-08-02-how-to-buy %})
them. Where? Either from Zold founders ([here](https://wts.zold.io/quick))
or on [an exchange]({% post_url 2019/04/2019-04-17-alterdice %}), from an existing owner of Zold coins.

Why did we decide to make it this way? You may watch

[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77pWgn_JVRk) videos, they explain.
