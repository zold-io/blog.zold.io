  To make security of RSA private keys easier we introduced
  keygaps, which are strong enough, but much more convenient.

To make a payment in almost any digital cryptographic system
you need a private [RSA key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_%28cryptosystem%29). Your public key is visible to everybody,
but the private key is what makes it possible to make modifications
to your wallets. This is exactly how Zold works too. However, remembering
those long multi-symbol cryptic texts is a hassle. For micro payments
it's easier to use _keygaps_.

<!--more-->

When you create a Zold wallet, you need a public RSA key. In order
to generate it you use [`ssh-keygen`](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/keygen/)
command line tool:

{% highlight text %}
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
{% endhighlight %}

You will get two files: `id_rsa.pub` is small, this is your public key,
`id_rsa` is much bigger, this is your private key. Then, you create a wallet:

{% highlight text %}
$ zold create --public-key=id_rsa.pub
{% endhighlight %}

See, the private key is not used at this step. Only the public one is
needed to create a wallet. The key will stay in the wallet for its
lifetime. For example, check this wallet [`00000000000ff1ce`](http://b1.zold.io/wallet/00000000000ff1ce.txt).
At the top of the file there is its public RSA key.

Then, when you send a payment, you have to provide your private RSA key,
in order to sign a transaction:

{% highlight text %}
$ zold pay --private-key=id_rsa \
  00000000000ff1ce 912ecc24b32dbe74 14.95
{% endhighlight %}

This is how it works from the command line. To make life easier for the
majority of our users we created a web wallet at [wts.zold.io](https://wts.zold.io).
There, all these operations are done from the web front. When you sign up,
the system generates two keys for you, creates a wallet, and pushes the wallet
to the network.

The problem we faced during the development of this system was: what should we do with your private key?
If we keep it in the database, you may not trust us, since there are two obvious
risks: we may steal your money and our database may get hacked. There are
plenty of incidents of both kinds at the modern crypto market.

On the other hand, asking you to store the private key locally and provide
it to us on every payment is not convenient at all. The key is big, that's why.

We found a solution, which we labeled _keygaps_. We simply take a piece
out of the private RSA key and return it to your on sign up: a small text
of 8 characters. Then, we remove that text from the RSA key and store the
key in the database. Then, when you want to make a payment, we ask you provide
that keygap. Then, we inject it into the RSA key from our database, make a
payment and throw the keygap away.

For example, this is my keygap: `5cth9vOt`. I'm kidding.

Thus, we never store your RSA private keys in our database. Even if we get hacked,
the keys won't be possible to use, since each of them will miss a small but
a very important part.

Also, it's convenient for a user to keep a small 8-characters keygap somewhere
secure and never worry about that large RSA private key.

Also, if you don't want to lose your wallet in case our [wts.zold.io](https://wts.zold.io)
is down or something else happens to us, you can download the key, inject your
keygap into it and use your wallet locally, from the command line.

What about security and its strength? Of course, the keygap is a much weaker
protection than the entire RSA key. There are only 62<sup>8</sup> (218 trillions) possible
combinations of it. With a pretty fast computer, in a few months of work, a
hacker may find it, if he or she has the RSA key, but doesn't have the missing
keygap. Thus, if 1) you really worry about your ZLD in the wallet, 2) the amount
is bigger than the cost of that super computer a hacker will have to use in order
to steal your money, and 3) you don't trust that our database is secure enough,
you should just work through our command line tool and never give away
your private RSA key, to nobody.

But since Zold is mostly targeted to micropayments, we believe that keygaps
will be strong enough for the majority of our users.
