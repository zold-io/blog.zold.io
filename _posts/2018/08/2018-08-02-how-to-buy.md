Zold is a cryptocurrency with a [mission]({% post_url 2018/07/2018-07-08-mission %}).
It doesn't have Airdrop or Bounty programs.
We created it as a catalyst for the revolution of software development industry, [Zerocracy](https://www.zerocracy.com) is leading.
There are only <del>three</del> four possible ways to get ZLD.

<!--more-->

First, you can fund any **sandbox** project managed by [Zerocrat](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/21/zerocracy-announcement.html) and get the equivalent amount of ZLD, according to the Exchange Rate at the moment of the contribution. Say, donate $32 and immediately get about 11 ZLD to your [web wallet](https://wts.zold.io) (1 ZLD = $2.95, at the moment of writing). We will identify you by your GitHub user name. Check out the projects [Board](https://www.0crat.com/board) and look for those with the "sandbox" badge.

You can even donate to Zold Ruby core project itself, just click this
button and pay via Stripe:

</a>

Second, you can instantly convert your bitcoins to zold
as [explained]({% post_url 2018/12/2018-12-09-btc-to-zld %}), just start
[here](https://wts.zold.io/quick) (you will be authenticated via mobile phone).

Third, you can [join](https://www.0crat.com/join) one of the projects
managed by Zerocrat as a programmer and receive ZLD for the tasks completed.
At the moment we give away ZLD as a bonus on top of every dollar you make
in Zerocracy. If you are a [good](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/07/24/bugs-or-pull-requests.html)
and disciplined programmer, you will make
<del>a few</del> 2-3 thousand US dollars (in ZLD) every months, working part-time.

Fourth, you can host your own Zold node and collect taxes and hosting bonuses.
[This page](https://github.com/zold-io/zold) explains how to do that. If your
node is powerful enough (more than 4 CPUs), you will earn 2-6 ZLD every day.

Fifth, you can buy ZLD at [AlterDice]({% post_url 2019/04/2019-04-17-alterdice %}),
the first crypto exchange that lists our coin.
