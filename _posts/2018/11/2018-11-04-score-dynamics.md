  Zold score is not a stable or predictable variable; however
  parallel threads stabilize it to some extend; here is how.

Each [Zold](https://www.zold.io) node has a score that reflects the amount of CPU power
it managed to invest into the system. It is expected that the longer
the node is online, the larger the score. However, this is not the case,
because the score expires in 24 hours and has to be re-calculated again.
Here is a quick summary of how exactly _score farming_ works.

<!--more-->

According to the [White Paper](https://papers.zold.io/wp.pdf), in order
to _earn_ a score, a node has to create a _prefix_ and then find a number
of text _suffixes_, which will satisfy a simple condition: a concatenation
of them with the prefix has to produce a zero-ending text after
being passed through SHA-256  hash-generating algorithm. The prefix,
according to our requirements, has to include the ISO-8601 time of the
moment it was created, for example:

{% highlight text %}
2018-06-27T06:22:41Z b2.zold.io 4096 THdonv1E@abcdabcdabcdabcd
{% endhighlight %}

Here, `2018-06-27T06:22:41Z` is the time when this prefix has been created. Here is the
first suffix a node may find: `3a934b`. Here is how
the entire text will look, before being sent to the SHA-256 hashing:

{% highlight text %}
2018-06-27T06:22:41Z b2.zold.io 4096 THdonv1E@abcdabcdabcdabcd 3a934b
{% endhighlight %}

The hash of this string will look like this:

{% highlight text %}
c9c72efbf6beeea13408c5e720ec42aec017c11c3db335e05595c03755000000
{% endhighlight %}

Pay attention to the trailing zeroes. There are six of them. This is the
_strength_ of the score. It's six. And the _value_ of the score is one,
because only one suffix was found and attached. The more suffixes are there,
the bigger the value, the more _valuable_ is the voice of this particular
node among all others. This is how the _proof-of-work_ works in Zold.

This is how the value of the score may look when growing in time:

However, a node can not keep finding those suffixes, endlessly growing the
value of the score. At some point it has to stop. This will happen exactly
in 24 hours after the moment the prefix was created. The score you see
above expired long time ago. If your node will show it to others, they will
reject it and the voice of your node won't be taken into account. The score
has to be _fresh_ enough in order to matter.

Here comes the problem I wanted to explain. If the node keeps working on
those suffixes, trying to find them, for 24 hours, its score will grow to a big
number. However, in 24 hours it will be wasted and the node will have to start
again. This is how the graph will look in reality:

Thus, the node will lose its voting power every 24 hours. It will stop
receiving taxes and [hosting bonuses]({% post_url 2018/08/2018-08-14-hosting-bonuses %}).
This is not what node owners really want to. In order to solve this issue
we calculate a number of scores at the same time, in parallel processes.
But if we just calculate them parallel, the graph will look like this:

<img src="/images/2018/11/score-3.png"/>

They will grow and expire synchronously. The result will not differ much
from what we had with a single process.

The solution, however, is simple, we start
calculating new scores a few times per day. And the distance between starting
points depends on the number of "threads" (parallel processes) the node
has configured. If the node runs 4 parallel threads, we start a new score
every 6 hours (24 divided by 4). Here is how the graph will look like:

<img src="/images/2018/11/score-4.png"/>

There is a "farm" inside each node, which is _farming_ those scores and
picks the largest one to use (the green line on the graph):

<img src="/images/2018/11/score-5.png"/>

Obviously, the larger the number of threads,
the more stable is the output. On the other hand, each thread is an additional
CPU load.

The number of threads is configured via `--threads` command line argument.
