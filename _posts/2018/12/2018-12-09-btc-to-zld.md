I [explained earlier]({% post_url 2018/08/2018-08-02-how-to-buy %})
that the only way to "buy" zolds is to [donate](https://www.0crat.com/contrib/CAZPZR9FS) some
cash into one of sandbox [Zerocracy](https://www.zerocracy.com)
projects to receive zolds as a gift. Today
we are announcing a new interface, to help you exchange zolds to bitcoins and vise
versa. Here is a quick explanation of how it's implemented and how it works.

<!--more-->

There are two interfaces, actually: 1) bitcoins to zolds, and 2) zolds to bitcoins.
To decide the conversion rate we take the market price of bitcoin from
[here](https://blockchain.info/ticker),
and assume that one ZLD equals to one USD. For example, if the market price of
BTC is $3,500 and you are selling 50 ZLD, you will get 0.01429 BTC.

We also charge 10% comission in both operations.

## BTC to ZLD

First, we create a unique BTC address for you via Blockchain
API [`/receive`](https://www.blockchain.com/api/api_receive) request. You
can find that address [here](https://wts.zold.io/btc). We store the address
in our database and it won't change, staying attached to your GitHub name
forever (this is how we identify users in [WTS](https://wts.zold.io), by their GitHub names).

Then, you can send your BTC to this address. Once they arrive, Blockchain
API will send us a webhook [notification](https://www.blockchain.com/api/api_receive).
Once it arrives, we check the transaction in Bitcoin ledger to make sure
it really happened, the amount received is correct, and there are enough
confirmations (we need at least 4).

If everything is clean, we store the Bitcoin transaction hash in our database (to
avoid duplicates) and send you zolds, to your wallet, in the right amount.
Then, we push your wallet and the sending wallet to Zold network.

It's important to mention that it will take some time before we can see
the fourth confirmation. Sometimes 40 minutes, sometimes [much longer](https://www.blockchain.com/en/charts/avg-confirmation-time).
Thus, stay patient after you send you bitcoins and wait.
If you don't see zolds in your wallet in a day, drop us a message
in [Telegram](https://t.me/zold_io).

## ZLD to BTC

You fill the [form](https://wts.zold.io/btc) and we immediately contact
[Coinbase API](https://developers.coinbase.com/)
to request a bitcoin transfer from our account to the
address you provided. They respond immediately and payments gets into
Bitcoin ledger. We also almost immediately deduct the right amount
of zolds from your wallet and push the wallet to Zold network.

Since Zold technology is still rather immature, to avoid big monetary losses,
we put certain limits on this operation. You can't send more than 4 ZLD per day
and you can't do more than one operation per day. We are planning to remove
the limitations soon.

If you don't see bitcoins in a few hours, drop us a message
in [Telegram](https://t.me/zold_io).
