If you want to contribute with an article, you should
just submit a pull request with your new file in `_drafts`

the necessary changes. Then, leave it in the `_drafts` directory
and submit a pull request.

we are interested in.

If you want to see how your article looks in web, you can "run" the
blog rendering engine locally. To do that, you will have to install
[Ruby 2.3+](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/),
[Rubygems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download),
and

Then, run this:

```bash
$ bundle update
$ bundle exec jekyll serve --future --drafts
```

Then, open this URL in your browser: [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).
You may continue making changes to your text in the `_drafts` directory
and refresh the page.

Please, make sure your blog post looks brilliant before submitting a pull request.
